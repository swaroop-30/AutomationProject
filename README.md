# AutomationProject
E-Commerce website Automation

The project helps to automate the process of browsing a dynamic E-commerce website

We take the help of a demo e-com website on internet: http://tutorialsninja.com/demo/

In this project, We used Selenium with Python and deployed the code on heroku and git

The python script performs the automated tasks, captures screenshots of desired items and prints out the final price of the order in the terminal
